# 🌍 Global Air Quality Analysis: EDA & Predictive Modeling

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **global air quality data** using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and applies machine learning models to predict **Air Quality Index (AQI)** and categorize it into health-based groups (Good, Moderate, Unhealthy, etc.).  

The notebook [`Global_Air_Quality_Project.ipynb`](./Global_Air_Quality_Project.ipynb) contains the full workflow with visualizations, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

## 🔍 Key Steps in the Project
1. **Data Understanding & Cleaning**
   - Loaded and inspected the dataset  
   - Handled missing values & ensured data types were correct  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Summary statistics & pollutant distributions  
   - Outlier detection using boxplots & KDE plots  
   - Correlation analysis between pollutants & AQI  
   - Time-based analysis (Year, Month, Weekday trends)  

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extracted temporal features (Year, Month, Day, Weekday)  
   - Categorized AQI into health-based groups (Good, Moderate, Unhealthy, etc.)  

5. **Conclusions**
   - Dataset showed no extreme outliers  
   - Pollutants like PM2.5 and PM10 strongly correlated with AQI  
   - Classification models effectively predicted AQI categories
